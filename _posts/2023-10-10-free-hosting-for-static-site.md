Static site hosting is a type of web hosting that stores your website's files as static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This means that your website's files do not change dynamically when users visit your site. Static site hosting is a good option for websites that do not require dynamic content, such as personal websites, portfolios, and landing pages.

## Benefits of static site hosting

Static site hosting has a number of benefits, including:
- **Speed:** Static sites are typically faster than dynamic sites because they do not need to generate content on the fly.
- **Security:** Static sites are more secure than dynamic sites because they are less vulnerable to attacks.
- **Scalability:** Static sites can be easily scaled to handle high traffic volumes.
Cost: Static site hosting is often less expensive than dynamic site hosting.
