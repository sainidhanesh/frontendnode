## What is CSS Accent Color?
The CSS accent-color property sets the accent color for user interface controls generated by some elements, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, range inputs, and progress bars. It is a relatively new property, and is currently only supported by a subset of browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## How to Use CSS Accent Color

To use the accent-color property, simply set it to the desired color value, such as red, #ff0000, or rgb(255, 0, 0). You can apply the property to any element, but it will only have an effect on elements that generate user interface controls.

For example, the following CSS code will set the accent color for all radio buttons on the page to red:

```css
input[type="radio"] {
  accent-color: red;
}
```

You can also use the accent-color property to target specific user interface controls. For example, the following CSS code will set the accent color for the range input with the ID my-range to blue:

```css
#my-range {
  accent-color: blue;
}
```

## Why Use CSS Accent Color

There are several benefits to using the accent-color property:

- It allows you to easily customize the appearance of user interface controls.
- It can help to improve accessibility by ensuring that there is sufficient contrast between the accent color and the background color.
- It can help to create a more consistent user experience across different browsers and devices.
